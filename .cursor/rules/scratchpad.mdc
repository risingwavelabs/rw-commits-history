# Scratchpad: RisingWave Release Progress Visualization

## Task
Create a visualization to track risingwavelabs/risingwave release progress, showing 4 key timestamps for each version:
1. Release branch created (merge-base)
2. First release (e.g., v2.0.1)
3. Last patch release (e.g., v2.0.6)
4. Last commit in the release branch (e.g., HEAD of release-2.0)
