# Scratchpad: RisingWave Release Progress Visualization

## Task
Create a visualization to track risingwavelabs/risingwave release progress, showing 4 key timestamps for each version:
1. Release branch created (merge-base)
2. First release (e.g., v2.0.1)
3. Last patch release (e.g., v2.0.6)
4. Last commit in the release branch (e.g., HEAD of release-2.0)

## Current Task: Fix Git Command Issues in CI
[X] Fix git merge-base command failures in CI environment
- Issue: git commands failing in /tmp directory
- Root cause: Incorrect git repository path handling in temporary directory
- Solution: Modified git clone and command execution:
  1. Changed from bare clone to no-checkout clone for better branch handling
  2. Fixed repository path to use a subdirectory in temp directory
  3. Added explicit fetch of all branches
  4. Simplified remote reference handling

## Current Task: Fix Multiple Repository Clones Issue
[X] Fix inefficient repository cloning in ThreadPoolExecutor
- Issue: Each thread is cloning the repository independently
- Root cause: Repository cloning is inside the thread function
- Solution implemented:
  1. Moved repository cloning to before ThreadPoolExecutor creation
  2. Added repo_path parameter to get_branch_creation_date and process_branch_data
  3. Improved error handling and repository path management
  4. Cleanup happens after all threads are done
  5. Maintained backward compatibility with local repository usage
